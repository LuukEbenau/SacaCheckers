# SacaCheckers

This project is a project I've made for my study earlier in 2018, and I decided I decided to put it here on github, to perhaps help some people.

Sacacheckers is a Checkers (Droughts) game, made in WPF. 
##Main goals & Features:
 -Singleplayer 1v1
 -Singleplayer vs AI (currently I have an AI using the minimax algorithm & alpha beta pruning, optimized using multiple threads.)
 -Playback of the moves in the game afterwards
 -Timed turns
 
I put it on Github to perhaps help some other people with an example of the MiniMax algorithm in checkers; who want to make checkers themselves or who want to continue to the project/ fork the project.

If you found any of my project helpful, i would appreciate a star :)

And if you have any questions, feel free to ask!
